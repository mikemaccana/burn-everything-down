# Burn Everything Down & Use Flex

This talk is online at [Burn everything down and use flex by default](http://mikemaccana.github.io/burn-everything-down/#1)

It's 2015. Floats? Centering with margin: auto? overflow for things that don't overflow? Displaying blocks as table cells?

You already know flex. This isn't a HOWTO. It's a talk about making layouts in SASS for modern web apps:

 - Using flex to simulate common layout patterns
 - Why you don't care about flex syntax differences
 - Why you don't care about flex syntax at all
 - I don't believe you. Who else is doing this?
